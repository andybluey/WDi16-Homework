      <p>Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them. - John von Neumann</p>
      <p>With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk. - John von Neumann</p>
      <p>He was a really remarkable man. He listened to me talk about this rather obscure subject and in ten minutes he knew more about it than I did. - David Blackwell</p>
      <p>The only student of mine I was ever intimidated by. He was so quick. - George PÃ³lya</p>
